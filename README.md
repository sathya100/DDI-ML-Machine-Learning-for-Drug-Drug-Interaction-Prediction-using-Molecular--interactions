# DDI-ML-Machine-Learning-for-Drug-Drug-Interaction-Prediction-using-Molecular--interactions
The objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict drug-drug interactions (DDIs) using both molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, TPSA, rotatable bonds) and molecular fingerprints derived from SMILES strings.
